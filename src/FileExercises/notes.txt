How Does Scanner Work?
 The nextByte(), nextShort(), nextInt(), nextLong(), nextFloat(), next
Double(), and next() methods are known as token-reading methods, because they read 
tokens separated by delimiters. By default, the delimiters are whitespace characters. You 
can use the useDelimiter(String regex) method to set a new pattern for delimiters.
 How does an input method work? A token-reading method first skips any delimiters (whites
pace characters by default), then reads a token ending at a delimiter. The token is then auto
matically converted into a value of the byte,short,int,long,float, or double type for 
nextByte(), nextShort(), nextInt(), nextLong(), nextFloat(), and nextDou
ble(), respectively. For the next() method, no conversion is performed. If the token does 
not match the expected type, a runtime exception java.util.InputMismatchException
 will be thrown. 
Both methods next() and nextLine() read a string. The next() method reads a string 
delimited by delimiters, and nextLine() reads a line ending with a line separator.
